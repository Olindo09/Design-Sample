# Dashboard Design Overview

This financial analysis dashboard is designed with a **clean, modern layout** that balances quick insights with detailed drill-down capabilities. The design emphasizes clarity, hierarchy, and intuitive navigation.

## ðŸŽ¨ Layout & Structure
- **Header Section:**  
  The top row displays the most important KPIs (Revenue, Expenses, Gross Profit, EBIT, Net Profit) in large, bold cards with consistent formatting and color contrast for easy scanning.  

- **Sidebar Navigation:**  
  A vertical menu on the left provides structured navigation across different sections: Overview, Revenue, Expenses, Ratios, Table, and Glossary. Icons are used for quick recognition alongside text labels, improving usability.  

- **Main Analysis Area:**  
  Split into multiple panels:  
  - **KPI Selector:** Buttons for toggling between financial KPIs (Opex, Gross Profit, EBIT, etc.), giving users quick control over which metric is highlighted.  
  - **Break-even Chart:** Combines bar and line elements to show Opex values alongside Opex margin percentages, creating a dual perspective on performance.  
  - **Financial Progression (Waterfall):** A step-by-step visual showing how revenue transitions through costs and expenses down to net profit.  

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design Choices
- **Color Scheme:**  
  - Dark navy and grey backgrounds for the sidebar and headers, providing strong contrast.  
  - Highlighted KPIs use bold white/yellow-on-dark blocks, making top metrics stand out immediately.  
  - Yellow accent color used in line charts and waterfall highlights to draw attention to trends and flow.  

- **Typography:**  
  - Large numeric displays for KPIs ensure visibility.  
  - Consistent sans-serif fonts across all panels for modern readability.  

- **Interactive Elements:**  
  - Filter reset button in the top right for quick dashboard refresh.  
  - Drill-down and zoom-in options on charts (supported by the charting engine).  

## ðŸ§© Design Principles Applied
- **Hierarchy:** Key KPIs are placed at the top in large cards, secondary details (charts and flows) sit below.  
- **Consistency:** Repeated use of rectangular cards and uniform spacing creates a balanced layout.  
- **Clarity:** Minimal clutter with clear labels, tooltips, and legends so the user knows exactly what each chart conveys.  
- **Scalability:** Side navigation allows for expansion into deeper financial analysis without crowding the overview page.
